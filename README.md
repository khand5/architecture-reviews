## Project Notes:

Disclaimer: This project uses the React framework to render all components. I apologize for including dynamic rendering in this part of the assignment. The Professor assured us in the beginning that we were allowed to use other libraries so I just went ahead and wrote the entire App in JSX.

I wasn't able to get nginx to port forward to the main html page for some reason, I am looking into this issue, hopefully, I will have this resolved for submission 2.

Some other notes:

1. JavaScript was used to implement the dropdown functionality in search form.
2. BONUS: I implemented @media queries for reactive design.

## How to start the client.

Please change to the client directory:

### `cd client`

Install all node modules.

### `npm install` or `npx install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
